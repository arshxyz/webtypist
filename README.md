# Webtypist

[Webtypist](https://webtypist.vercel.app) is a browser-based typing tutor.

It teaches you how to touch-type and improve your typing speed. There are a plenty of lessons ranging from beginner to advanced including one for programmers (`(p) series`) and special keyboards (Numpad `(n) series`, Colemak `(c series)`)

Give it a try here - [webtypist.vercel.app](https://webtypist.vercel.app)

Webtypist is inspired by GNU typist (`gtypist`) and is capable of parsing and running `.typ` lessons built for GNU Typist. In other words, you can call it gtypist for the web.


## Lessons included
- Quick QWERTY (q) Series
- Long QWERTY (r) Series
- Speed Drills (s) Series
- Programmer (p) Series
- QWERTY review (u) Series
- Numpad (n) Series
- Colemak (c) Series
- Dvorak (d) Series

## How do I make my own lesson?
All lessons on webtypist are GNU typist `.typ` files which are inside the `/public` folder of this repository. Have a look at `demo.typ` to understand the basic commands used. Open [webtypist](https://webtypist.vercel.app) and click the "Make your own lesson" button to see how `demo.typ` runs.
