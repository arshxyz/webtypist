D:Tonight Nan opens the piano.  She sings such good songs and
 :soon dashes into a dance.  Nan can dance.  The noise stops.

D:Nan gets us going.  The dance is on.  Ted pounds the piano

D:At eight papa said that he ought to put out his good pipe

 :At eight ten I guess the dance gets going.  At ten it stops.
 :As papa put it, such singing upsets him enough for one night.

I:(7)

D:Get the gang.  Catch this sign.  Get going.  Go up this high
 :post and put a sign on top.  Put these copies on each post.
 :I guess no one intends to stop us.  The cast is set.  Each
 :scene is set.  Each act can open in good shape.  I hope that
 :enough cash is paid in so the cast need not stand the costs.

T:			SPEED EXERCISES
 :
 :From now on, I will be mixing speed exercises in with the lessons.  In the
 :drills that you have been doing, I make you keep practicing a line until
 :you get it right.  In a speed exercise, I will only display the text once.
 :
 :What will be different is that I will be timing you.  From the time you type
 :the first letter of the line until you hit the final carriage return, my
 :stopwatch will be running.  When you finish, I will calculate your typing speed
 :and convert it to words per minute (WPM).  I will also count each of the
 :mistakes you make and display the total number of errors.
 :
 :If you make a mistake, I will beep at you and light up the letter that you
 :should have typed in inverse video (a black letter on a white background).
 :Just keep going and try to make as few errors as possible.

I:(8) Pointer Paragraph (o e)
*:_R_R_L9
S:     Only too well do we know about your house.  Mother told
 :me you hope to be settled there quite soon.  Of course she
 :would enjoy seeing the whole house next week.  Before then
 :please write her a letter to let her know how to get there
 :from here.  We know you have moved to a very cozy new home.

I:(9) Test Paragraph
*:_R_R_L10
S:     The High dance opens at eight and the gang is going.
 :So Ted shuts the piano and stops at the phone to catch Ann.
 :I ought to post Ted that he pounds the piano as I once did.
 :I guess he is upset.  He has to catch Dad to get the cash.
 :He has to see Ann to each dance.  This is not a noisy night.
 :His auto is a cheap one and no good on a night such as this.

 :Soon the pair share a snug rug and start out in our red car.

I:(5)
*:_R_R_L16
D:On a poor, rough road, Dan dares to rush in the rain.  Soon
 :he sees a horse ahead.  He tries hard to stop.  The car hits
 :and then turns around.  The horse runs east at a great rate.

I:(6)
*:_R_R_L17
D:In order to raise a poor grade one tries to use good sense.
 :An error is a sure sign not to do the thing that one did.
 :An error seen once does not hurt.  As soon as an error is
 :seen or heard again, note its sort and end it right there.

I:(7)
*:_R_R_L18
D:Her error is a sign that this thing or that has upset her.
 :Does she care?  Is it a hard part?  She has to get used to
 :the letters that she has to print.  Is this order upset?
 :Is she tired?  Then she needs a short rest.  Is it the rate?
 :She need not raise her rate too high.  Has she a good touch?

 :through the streets to their very high hotel.  Hal hesitated
 :to start north without warm clothes.  Although he hated to
 :hurt his health, Hugh started north quickly on the sixteenth.

S:     Dad and his son are to start on a trip in our red car.
 :House cares are the sort that upset Dad and he is so tired
 :that he tries a nap in order to rest.  It rains at a great

*:_R_R_L24
D:As a rule it is the real line drill that helps one to learn.

I:(4)
*:_R_R_L25
D:It helps to read a line as soon as one can.  It helps to see
 :its sense.  This, indeed, helps to hold each line until done.

I:(5)
*:_R_R_L26
D:As soon as one hits a hard place then one plans to drill on
 :this part.  Later one can drill this hard part again.  In
 :order to end an error one can drill all the old line again.

I:(6)
*:_R_R_L27
D:Learn the sound as one uses loose hands to type out a line.
 :As one types his usual rate he ought to learn its sound until
 :at this rate all the line has the usual, clean, clear sound.
 :As soon as the usual rate is lost one can hear it as a slip.

I:(7)
*:_R_R_L28
D:Total lines that one turns out tell all that one is young.
 :In order that this class also can print a large line total,
 :it still helps to spell; it also helps to print all the line
 :as one line, and it helps less and less to drill single
 :letters.  Each one in the class can tell his total lines.

S:Dear Ted,
 :
 :     A day ago Ann got a bad cut on her arm and a few by her
 :eye and ear.  It is an act of God she did not die.  Her car
 :did the job.  It is the end of her car.  She has no use for a
 :car.  The fee is to be big.  She is in bed, but she can not
 :eat.  She can not eat a bit of egg.  It is no fun at all.
 :
 :     It is hot.  It is too hot for her fur hat, but I can buy
 :a box for it.  I am due any day.  I can cut a day if I fly.
 :It is not far if I go by air.  If I go by car, I add a day.
 :
 :     How is Dan?  Did he get his job?  Dan had to beg for it
 :if he did.  He is big and fat but not bad.  The boy can do
 :it if he can act to fit his age.  Ask him not to act as a kid.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

I:(9) Test Paragraph
*:_R_R_L30
S:     To tell this class all there is to learn is not a real
 :help later.  Let the class plan the loose ease that can hold
 :each hand in place, or plan to end this or that poor slip,
 :or plan to do its total lines in less hours.  As a rule, to
 :plan and to do are also to learn.  The class plans to drop
 :the old action to clear the road.  Those old slips are lost.
 :The class has large plans; gains in hours and less slips.

*:_R_R_L31

D:All loose lots are sent on fast local lines at a half rate,

D:This offer is only for fancy fresh fruit to be used as gifts.

 :After at least four days you can order daily or on Friday.

S:Dear Ted,
 :
 :     After I read your dandy note I felt sorry for the lady.
 :Here is plenty of cash if you young people agree to spend it

 :Dan play or fight?  Dan said he felt as if a full load of
 :coal hit his head.  Is that fact or fancy?
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

I:(7) Pointed Paragraph (a s)
*:_R_R_L38
S:     Sadness possesses her as she stands against the panes
 :that the sash separates.  She is sad because the same dress
 :is not washed and in shape; and so she says it is useless to
 :save it.  She is sad also because she has to stay in Alabama
 :next season.  She says to plan to sail across the seas to
 :Alaska or Asia or Spain is useless.  So in June she amuses
 :herself by drawing five or six quaint, small-sized maps.

I:(8) Test Paragraph
*:_R_R_L39
S:     They say this fruit is the finest.  It is full and good.
 :Dr. Ted feels the first fruit is too green for young or old.
 :After one eats any of it he is sorry.  In fact, if I try it,
 :that night in fancy I sail the South Seas for eight hours.
 :The air is fine and clear; on the ship are only fruit and I.
 :To a lady in those seas I gladly offer all fruit and candy.
 :There is no reply.  Only the seas run high and I feel ill.

D:To learn to type, first get a nice rate going, then hold it.

I:(4)
*:_R_R_L44
D:If you read copy set your eyes on that copy and stay on it.
 :If you hear copy then use your eyes to hit sure and fast.

I:(5)
*:_R_R_L45
D:Do not hurry.  Set a nice rate.  Yet hit each letter fast.
 :To strike letters start easily and fast and use a light touch.
 :You can not type lightly and faster if you start to pound.

I:(6)
*:_R_R_L46
D:It is a slip if you do not use a letter in its right order,
 :since in line after line each has its place on the paper.
 :You soon learn the usual order for all letters that you type
 :and learn to print the letters in any necessary order.

I:(7)
*:_R_R_L47
D:It is easy at first to make errors by losing this usual order.
 :If you read, hold the eyes on copy to help get this order.
 :If you do hit this or that letter out of order, it is not
 :that you fail to spell.  You can spell and yet not type;
 :this fine class drill is to help the type fly in fair order.

S:Dear Tom,
 :
 :     Mr. May has one new car.  It has a low red top.  The top
 :is so low you can not see the sun if you sit in the car.  Mr.
 :May has not let his own son use it.  I saw his son try to put
 :the top up.  I ran and met him.  Why not be men and run the car
 :out?  We did.  We set out to run it at six.  We two ran it off
 :to an old lot by the sea.
 :
 :     Did his pa see us?  Yes, sir, who but Pa was at No. Ten
 :as we ran by in the car--and Ma, too.  Oh, it was war--his pa
 :had a lot to say.  Let me lay out the law to you.  You may not
 :use the car as you did not pay for it.  You are not yet a man.
 :Son did not lie nor did he win his way.
 :
 :     How are you all?  Now if you get a new car, let me run it.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

I:(9) Pointed Paragraph (t c)
*:_R_R_L49
S:     Is it quite certain that the citizens could continue the
 :old conditions if they voted a straight ticket?  If we accept
 :as accurate the picture of recent conditions, we can not crave
 :to continue them.  We lack the tact to get the citizens to
 :vote a split ticket.  Tax collectors try to collect taxes on
 :vacant lots.  A discount for cash increases collections.

D:Who was the lady with the vivid hair in the dress of heavy

I:(7)
*:_R_R_L67
D:The queen put this query in a quick voice to quell them all:
 :Why does the whole world love a lover?  Why do we value you?
 :All did laugh.  The queen asked that, as a favor, you give us

S:     Satisfy yourself that it will be funny, but perfectly
 :satisfactory, for forty or fifty of the faculty to fly from
 :Buffalo to New York on the first Friday in February.  If
 :they prefer, we will offer them waffles, jelly, and coffee
 :before they fly or get dizzy.  Sixty flyers can qualify
 :confidently to face any difficulty.  A friendly inquiry
 :from any family will be very cheerfully and fully answered.

*:_R_R_L89
S:     Children find being quizzed in division, addition, and
 :reading difficult.  They studied daily during their third
 :period and tried to be confident.  I think they did include
 :Florida and Rhode Island in their wide reading; and have
 :just decided to dispose of Detroit, Grand Rapids, Richmond,
 :Providence, and Philadelphia next week.

I:(9) Test Paragraph
*:_R_R_L90
S:     By using the new banks of keys on the new keyboard, you
 :are able to learn or excel with less labor.  These new banks
 :have been based on an exact table of words used.  You begin
 :at once on the best bank.  On the old keyboard you have to
 :type most of the text on the next bank above and on the bank
 :below.  Because of this fact your fingers bound back and
 :forth between the upper and lower banks of keys.  But those
 :extra jumps necessary on the old keyboard do not exist on the
 :new keyboard.  Nor is your left hand taxed with extra labor.
 :The keys are fixed to keep both hands busy and in balance.
