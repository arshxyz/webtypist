T:			SPEED PRACTICE SERIES
 :
 :The S series of lessons is designed to help you improve your typing speed
 :and accuracy.  It is assumed that you have already learned how to touch
 :type either from a previous course in touch typing or from the T series of
 :these lessons.
 :
 :You can use this series even if you do not know how to touch type.  But, it is
 :recommended that you at least learn to touch type most of the letters of the
 :alphabet before starting this series.  When you encounter a letter or symbol
 :which you have not learned, you will have to look.  This is a very bad habit to
 :get into and is hard to break.  (You needn't worry if you only need to glance
 :down for unusual keys, like the dollar sign.)

*:_S_R_L1
T:			   RULES OF THE GAME
 :
 :I will display a paragraph on the screen.  You should then type the entire
 :paragraph as quickly and as accurately as possible.   As you type each
 :character, I will immediately check it for accuracy.  If it was right, I won't
 :do anything.  But, if you made a mistake, I will beep and write that letter in
 :inverse video (a black character on a white background).  You can ignore the
 :error and continue going; or, you can backup and correct it with the DELETE
 :or BACKSPACE keys.  (I will still count it as an error though.)
 :
 :I will also be timing you.  From the time you type the first character until
 :you hit the final carriage return, my stop watch will be going.  At the
 :end of the paragraph, I will tell you your rating (in words-per-minute).
 :
 :If you made too many mistakes, try the next paragraph slower.  If you made no
 :mistakes or only one or two, try the next one faster.

I:First, a quick warm-up.
*:_S_R_L2
S:The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs.

I:Once more:
*:_S_R_L3
S:The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs.

I:If the cursor is on a blank line, type return to skip it
*:_S_R_L4
S:Dear Sirs:
 :
 :I have just purchased a Heathkit H89 computer system and would
 :like to order two boxes of diskettes for it.  This system uses
 :5 1/4 inch, hard-sectored, ten-sector, single-sided, single-
 :density diskettes.
 :
 :Enclosed is my check for $45.00.  Please rush this order, as I
 :can not use my system before they arrive.
 :
 :Sincerely,
 :
 :Mr. Smith

*:_S_R_L5
S:Dear Sirs:
 :
 :Thank you for sending the diskettes so promptly.  How-
 :ever, the diskettes which you sent are for soft-sectored
 :drives.  As I stated in my original letter my system
 :accepts only ten-sector, hard-sectored diskettes.
 :
 :I will return these two boxes as soon as I receive the
 :correct ones.
 :
 :Sincerely,
 :
 :Mr. Smith

*:_S_R_L6
S:Dear Mr. Smith:
 :
 :Thank you for informing us that the diskettes which you pur-
 :chased from us are not satisfactory.  We are sorry for the
 :inconvenience you have been caused in this transaction.
 :
 :We shall be glad to replace the diskettes you now have or to
 :allow you to select a different brand.  If you will let us know
 :your wishes we shall be glad to give the matter our immediate
 :attention.
 :
 :We hope you will give us the opportunity to prove to you that
 :this incident is most unusual and that we do strive to render
 :to our customers an efficient and courteous service at all
 :times.

I:Harry S. Truman

I:H. L. Mencken

T:
 :In this lesson you will be given several excerpts from the classics.
 :Take your time and type them carefully.

I:A Christmas Carol, Stave One, Marley's Ghost
*:_S_R_L28
S:Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all par-
 :ticular about the knocker on the door, except that it
 :was very large.  It is also a fact, that Scrooge had
 :seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
 :in that place; also that Scrooge has as little of what
 :is called fancy about him as any man in the city of
 :London, even including--which is a bold word--the
 :corporation, aldermen, and livery.  Let it also be
 :borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one
 :thought on Marley, since his last mention of his
 :seven year's dead partner that afternoon.  And then
 :let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened
 :that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,
 :saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any inter-
 :mediate process of change--not a knocker, but Mar-
 :ley's face.

I:Gulliver's Travels, Chapter One, A Voyage to Lilliput
*:_S_R_L29
S:When I awaked it was just daylight.  I attempted to rise, but I
 :found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to
 :the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied to the
 :ground in the same manner.  I likewise felt several slender
 :ligatures across my body, from my armpits to my thighs.  I
 :could only look upward; the sun began to grow hot, and the
 :light offended my eyes.  I heard a confused noise about me;
 :but in the posture I lay could see nothing except the sky.  In a
 :little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg,
 :which, advancing gently forward over my breast, came almost up
 :to my chin; when bending my eyes downward as much as I could, I
 :perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a
 :bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back.  In the
 :mean time I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I
 :conjectured) following the first.

I:Treasure Island, Chapter IV, "The Sea Chest", by Stevenson.
*:_S_R_L30
S:I lost no time, of course, in telling my mother all that
 :I knew, and perhaps should have told her long before,
 :and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous
 :position.  Some of the man's money--if he had any--was
 :certainly due to us; but it was not likely that our
 :captain's shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by
 :me, Black Dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to
 :give up their booty in payment of the dead man's debts.
 :The captain's order to mount at once and ride for Dr.
 :Livesey would have left my mother alone and unprotected,
 :which was not to be thought of.  Indeed, it seemed
 :impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the
 :house:  the fall of coals in the kitchen grate, the very
 :ticking of the clock, filled us with alarms.

I:Treasure Island, Chapter IV, "The Sea Chest", by Stevenson.
*:_S_R_L31
S:The neighborhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by
 :approaching footsteps; and what between the dead
 :body of the captain on the parlor floor, and the thought
 :of that detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand,
 :and ready to return, there were moments when, as the
 :saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror.  Something
 :must speedily be resolved upon; and it occurred to us at
 :last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbor-
 :ing hamlet.  No sooner said than done.  Bareheaded as we
 :were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and
 :the frosty fog.

*:_S_R_L32
T:
 :In this lesson you will be given several soliloquies from
 :Shakespeare's plays.  The spelling and punctuation are
 :quite hard.  Take your time and type them carefully.

I:Romeo and Juliet, Act II, Scene II (Capulet's Garden).
*:_S_R_L33
S:But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
 :It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!--
 :Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
 :Who is already sick and pale with grief,
 :That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
 :Be not her maid, since she is envious;
 :Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
 :And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.--
 :It is my lady; O, it is my love!
 :O, that she knew she were!--
 :She speaks, yet she says nothing:  what of that?
 :Her eye discourses, I will answer it.--
 :I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:

*:_S_R_L34
S:Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
 :Having some business, do entreat her eyes
 :To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
 :What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
 :The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
 :As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
 :Would through the airy region stream so bright
 :That birds would sing, and think it were not night.--
 :See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
 :O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
 :That I might touch that cheek!

I:Julius Caesar, Act III, Scene II (The Forum).
*:_S_R_L35
S:Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
 :I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
 :The evil that men do lives after them;
 :The good is oft interred with their bones;
 :So let it be with Caesar:  The noble Brutus
 :Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
 :If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
 :And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
 :Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,--
 :For Brutus is an honourable man;
 :So are they all, all honourable men,--
 :Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
 :He was my friend, faithful and just to me;
 :But Brutus says he was ambitious;
 :And Brutus is an honourable man.

*:_S_R_L36
S:He hath brought many captives home to Rome.
 :Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
 :Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
 :When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
 :Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
 :Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
 :And Brutus is an honourable man.
 :You all did see that on the Lupercal
 :I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
 :Which he did thrice refuse:  was this ambition?
 :Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
 :And, sure, he is an honourable man.

*:_S_R_L37
S:I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
 :But here I am to speak what I do know.
 :You all did love him once,--not without cause:
 :What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?
 :O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
 :And men have lost their reason!--Bear with me;
 :My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
 :And I must pause till it come back to me.

I:The Merchant of Venice, Act IV, Scene I (A Court of Justice).
*:_S_R_L38
S:The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
 :It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
 :Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;
 :It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
 :'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
 :The throned monarch better than his crown;
 :His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
 :The attribute to awe and majesty,
 :Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;

*:_S_R_L39
S:But mercy is above this scepter'd sway,--
 :It is enthroned in the heart of kings,
 :It is an attribute to God himself;
 :And earthly power doth then show likest God's
 :When mercy seasons justice.  Therefore, Jew,
 :Though justice be thy plea consider this--
 :That in the course of justice none of us
 :Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
 :And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
 :The deeds of mercy.  I have spoke thus much
 :To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
 :Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
 :Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
