 :deeds clarify it.  The test of a man's sincerity is not what
 :he says but what he does.  Consider this well and you will
 :never be confused in estimating a man's worth.

 :an enemy of success.  We are told that this is an age of
 :specialization, and specialization demands concentration.

 :thing to say and they say it interestingly and to the point.

 :that is not to say that it should not have style.

 :
 :Very truly yours,

I:(6)
*:_U_R_L67
S:Strive for typing accuracy.  Speed without accuracy is of little value.
 :Rhythm is the secret of typing skill.  Don't write one part of a word
 :faster than another.  Slow down so that you can maintain a regular rhythm.
 :
 :Think of the letters before you strike them.  Strike the keys evenly, so
 :that the printing impression does not vary.  At the same time, try to
 :develop your stroking speed and make it a habit to release the keys quickly.
 :To get up speed, type each exercise three or four times.
 :
 :To do your best, it is necessary that you be relaxed.  You may be trying so
 :hard that you are all tied up in knots.  Relax consciously.  If you have a
 :feeling of tenseness and hurry, you are not properly relaxed.
