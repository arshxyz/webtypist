B:                            Lesson T1

*:_T_R_L0
T:			Welcome to lesson T1.
 :
 :In the T series of lessons, we will be learning to touch-type on the standard
 :keyboard.  I will introduce you to each letter on the keyboard, one at a time.
 :By the time you have completed this series, you will be able to type the entire
 :alphabet, the numbers, and most of the punctuation keys by touch.
 :
 :If you have never taken any lessons in typing before, please be patient.  Typing
 :is not difficult but it does take a lot of practice.  Avoid the tendency to
 :look down at your fingers while typing.  This is a very bad habit and is hard
 :to break later.  If you hit the wrong key, I will let you know.  (But, I won't
 :tell anyone else, so don't worry about it.)
 :
 :If you have always used the hunt-and-peck method, you will have an even harder
 :time keeping yourself from looking.  Don't be surprised if you find touch
 :typing slower than your old ways.  It may be slower when you first start.
 :But, touch typing is far faster once you get the hang of it.
 :
 :If you can already touch type, you should be able to go through these lessons
 :fairly quickly.  Or, you may want to go directly to the S series.

*:_T_R_L1
T:
 :			The HOME Keys.
 :
 :In order to hit the correct keys by touch alone, you must always know where your
 :fingers are.  The way to do this is to have a special place for each finger.
 :This key is called the HOME position.
 :
 :Place the first finger of your right hand on the J-key.  Now, place your second
 :finger on the K-key, your third finger on the L-key, and your fourth-finger on
 :the ;-key (the one with the : and ; on it).
 :
 :Similarly place the four fingers of your left hand on the F, D, S, and A-keys.
 :Place your right thumb over the SPACE bar.  (Henceforth, always hit the SPACE
 :bar with this thumb.)  Now, lift all your fingers slightly so that they are
 :poised just over the keys.  Each finger should be just barely touching its home
 :key.  This is an electronic keyboard and does not take much pressure to ac-
 :cidentally press the key down.
 :
 :Learn these positions well.  Whenever you are about to type a line, look at your
 :fingers and make sure they are in the HOME position.  Then don't look at them
 :again.

*:_T_R_L2
T:
 :			DRILL PATTERNS
 :
 :For the rest of this lesson, I will display a line of text in the middle of the
 :screen and instructions at the top of the screen.
 :
 :All you have to do is type in the characters that you see in the middle of
 :the screen.  If you hit the correct key, I will not do anything.  If you make
 :a mistake, I will display a large X under the letter that you got wrong and 
 :beep the terminal. In either event, just keep going by typing the next letter.
 :
 :When you have finished typing the line, hit the RETURN key.  To do this, extend
 :the little finger of your right hand over to the RETURN key.  Hit the key and
 :zip the finger back to its home position.  Be careful not to let your other
 :fingers move far from their home positions in the process.  Also, be careful
 :not to type an extra space at the end of the line.
 :
 :If you made no mistakes on the line, I will display the next drill pattern.  If
 :you did make a mistake, I will beep at you and make you do the line again.  If
 :on the second try you made more than two mistakes, I will beep again and make
 :you try again, etc.  Don't forget to use your right thumb for the SPACE bar.

I:Hit the F-key four times with the first finger of your left hand.
*:_T_R_L3
D:ffff

I:Alternately, hit the F-key and the SPACE bar.

 :In this lesson, we will review the letters that you have already practiced
 :and will add the letters E, G, and H and the period.
 :
 :When you reach for any of these keys, be sure to return your finger to its
 :home position.  For example, to hit the H-key, move the first finger of your
 :right hand (the J-finger) slightly to the left.  Tap the H-key and immediately
 :bring your finger back over the J.
 :
 :If you lose track of where your fingers are guess.  Don't look!

T:			SPEED EXERCISES
 :
 :From now on, I will be mixing speed exercises in with the lessons.  In the
 :drills that you have been doing, I make you keep practicing a line until
 :you get it right.  In a speed exercise, I will only display the text once.
 :
 :What will be different is that I will be timing you.  From the time you type
 :the first letter of the line until you hit the final carriage return, my
 :stopwatch will be running.  When you finish, I will calculate your typing speed
 :and convert it to words per minute (WPM).  I will also count each of the
 :mistakes you make and display the total number of errors.
 :
 :If you make a mistake, I will beep at you and light up the letter that you
 :should have typed in inverse video (a black letter on a white background).
 :Just keep going and try to make as few errors as possible.

I:Try this sentence:
*:_T_R_L77
S:Sarah has liked knitting all her life.

I:Try a little longer sentence.
*:_T_R_L78
S:She looked past her garden to the fields and longed to see the other side.

I:When you type a multi-line paragraph, you will have to hit the RETURN-key at
 :the end of each line.
*:_T_R_L79
S:All the sane people in this area sold their gold
 :right at the start.  The insane ones held their
 :gold and later it paid off.

*:_T_R_L80
S:One fine afternoon the king had an idea.  He
 :sent a letter to all the lords and ladies of
 :his land.  He asked for a great feast.  His
 :people prepared roasts.  His jester did a jig.
 :All the people left hoping to do it again.

 :keep practicing until you get it right!)  But, I will accept either a BACK-
 :SPACE or a DELETE during a speed drill.  (I will remove the white error
 :markers but I still count it as an error in my totals.)

 :			NUMERIC KEYS
 :
 :The terminal has two sets of numeric keys.  One set--directly above the
 :alphabetic keys--conforms to the standard for typewriter keyboards.  The other
 :set--to your right--resembles a calculator keypad.  In this typing series we
 :will be concerned only with the standard numeric keys on the main keyboard.
 :(If you would like to learn to touch type on a numeric keypad, use the N-series
 :lessons instead.)
 :
 :NOTE - not all terminals have the numeric keys in a separate keypad
 :
 :The numeric keys, like all the keys you will be learning from now on, vary
 :somewhat from machine to machine.  The 2 through 0 keys are always in exactly
 :the same place on all typewriter keyboards.  (On keypunch machines and some
 :terminals, however, they are located over the U, I, O, J, K, L, M, comma and
 :period keys.  We will not be concerned with these layouts in this series.)
 :Even if a typewriter or terminal has the standard 2 through 0 keys, it may not
 :have a 1 key.  If it does, the 1 will always be next to the 2.  If it does not,
 :you will have to use the L-key.

I:Let's start by using the 1-key, since we have one.  (Use your A-finger.)
*:_T_R_L147
D:aaa a1a aaa 111 aaa a1a

*:_T_R_L148
D:a1q qa1 qz1 az1 aq1 a1z
 :111 and 111 ate 111 any 111
 :If 11 men each catch 11 fish in 11 days, how many fish were caught?

I:Use your S-finger for the 2-key.
*:_T_R_L149
D:sss s2s sss s2s sss s2s

*:_T_R_L149A
D:sss s2w sss 2xw sss w2x sss
 :222 saw 222 was 222 wet 222
 :The 2 men were 2 late 2 catch the 2 PM train.

#
I:Use your D-finger for the 3-key.
*:_T_R_L150
D:ddd d3d ddd d3d ddd d3d ddd

*:_T_R_L151
D:ddd d3e ddd d3c ddd e3c ddd
 :333 did 333 cat 333 eat 333
 :1 plus 2 is 3.  11 plus 22 is 33.  111 plus 222 is 333.

I:The last number we will practice today is the 4-key.  (Use your F-finger.)
*:_T_R_L152
D:fff f4f fff f4f fff f4f

*:_T_R_L153
D:fff f4r fff 4vr fff 4vr fff
 :444 for fff rat 444 vet 444
 :Flight 423 leaves from gate 42 at 4:24.
 :As the 3 musketeers say: 1 4 all, and all 4 1.
 :If 1/4 plus 2/3 is 11/12, what is 1/2 plus 1/3?

I:Try your speed on this line:
*:_T_R_L154
S:Our team won 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place at the 12th annual outing.

I:As we stated earlier, many typewriters do not have a 1 key.  Let's practice
 :using the L-key as a 1, so you can use any kind of typewriter.
*:_T_R_L155
D:One dozen is l2.  A gross is l2 dozen or l44.

*:_T_R_L156
D:In both octal and decimal, ll times ll is l2l.  And, 3 minus 4 is -l.
 :But in octal, l2 is not divisible by 3.

I:Let's try some paragraphs.
*:_T_R_L167
S:Zip codes are arranged so that the first 3 digits
 :designate the regional office and the last 2
 :digits designate the local branch.  The numbering
 :is roughly east to west.  That is, numbers
 :starting with 0 are in New England, numbers
 :starting with 1 are the New York area, etc.
 :There are notable exceptions to this rule,
 :however.  The Virgin Islands are south of
 :Florida, but their Zip Codes start with 00.

*:_T_R_L168
S:The new nine digit zip codes have upset quite a
 :few people.  It was bad enough being referred to
 :as 73218.  But now, we will have to remember
 :numbers like 73218-4208.  The worst hit will be

 :

 :done so, you should now start the N-series or S-series.
 :
 :There are a few keys which we have not studied.  If you decide to touch-type
 :these keys, use the closest finger.  Thus, the ESC, TAB, CAPS LOCK, and SCROLL
 :keys use the A-finger.  And, the keys to the far right (BACKSPACE, DELETE, LINE
 :FEED, RETURN, }, {, etc.) use the ;-finger.  The upper keys (f1, f2, etc.) are
 :not usually touch typed as the reach is too far.  If you can, fine.
 :
 :The CONTROL and REPEAT keys are difficult to touch type, but are treated like
 :the SHIFT keys whenever possible.  For example, to REPEAT an exclamation point,
 :hold the REPEAT key down with your ;-finger and then hit the ! with your A-
 :finger.  Certain command sequences, such as Control/S, are hard to do this way.
 :Many people simply hold the CONTROL-key down with their A-finger and then hit
 :the other key with whatever finger is convenient (usually the F-finger in this
 :case).
