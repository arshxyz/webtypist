*:_D_R_L0
T:			Welcome to the Dvorak Course
 :
 :This course has been planned for beginners as well as experienced typists.
 :If you are a beginner learning to type on the Dvorak keyboard (the American
 :Simplified Keyboard), you will find this keyboard easier to learn than the
 :QWERTY (Sholes) keyboard.
 :
 :This is because the Dvorak keyboard has been scientifically designed to minimize
 :cumulative finger motion while typing English. The ten letters on the home row
 :(A, O, E, U, I, D, H, T, N, and S) make up about 70% of all keystrokes. These
 :ten letters alone can form over 3000 words. Needless to say, having these keys
 :in the home row facilitates both speed and accuracy.
 :
 :If you are already an experienced typist on the Sholes keyboard, don't despair:
 :you won't have to unlearn everything you know. Your basic typing dexterity
 :remains with you, regardless of the keyboard layout. Learning the Dvorak
 :keyboard is like learning to "play on a new surface", as a tennis player must
 :learn to adjust to grass court or hard court when she has been accustomed to
 :playing on a clay court.

*:_D_R_L1
T:			General Instructions
 :
 :The fingers of the left hand should be placed over the A-key, the O-key,
 :the E-key, and the U-key. Similarly, the fingers of the right hand should be
 :placed over the H-key, the T-key, the N-key, and the S-key.
